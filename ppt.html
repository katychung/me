      <h1>PowerPoint to Video</h1>
      <p>In the workplace, video has been growing in popularity as an alternative to PowerPoint. GoAnimate wanted to take users PowerPoint files and turn them into a animated video.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Problem</h2>
        <p>For a long time, presentations slides have been a workplace norm. Need to explain something to a group of people? PowerPoint probably comes to mind as a possible delivery medium. Animated video sounds daunting for most people, they conjure up making video as something that requires a lot of time and talent to create -- story, characters, structure, visual, audio, creativity! So how can we transition and show the value of animated video as an worthy alternative to the slides that they use so habitually?</p> 

        <p>PowerPoint to Video aimed to reduce the entry barrier to the Video Maker app by letting users bring in their existing PowerPoint files and converting them into an animated video.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Role</h2>
        <p>Initially the work was done with 2 engineers who focused on technical feasibility while I focused on the UX/UI. There was some direction from the Head of Product.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting user expectations about the resulting video.</li>
          <li>Frequent feedback to user throughout the conversion process.</li>
          <li>Speed - converting the PowerPoint file should not take more than a couple of mins.</li>
          <li>Resulting video must be easy to edit</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
	        <li>Prototyping and testing would have been smarter and more cost effective.</li>
          <li>The different ways decisions are made in a company have taught me a few lessons on management and leadership.</li>
          <li>Timeboxing was very effective in delivering something on time but quality was affected. How could better project management allow for better quality..</li>
