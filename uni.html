            <h4>Pangram</h4>
            <p>Pangram is a social network for reviving and preserving minority languages. As spoken word comes before literacy (yet it is often the most ignored element) the site aims to provide an intriguing audio based platform that encourages the less fluent to connect with native speakers while adding to a growing archive of spoken word.</p>

            <h4>Everybody</h4>
            <p>A solo (and spanning one semester) 3rd year project experimenting with Processing, PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>The user types in an (anonymous) altruistic message, messages are stored and over time they are projected onto a surface for passers-by to view.</p>
            <p>This project involved learning Processing (open source IDE, using Java) from scratch and getting it to talk to MySQL. I am by no way a programmer but understand the fundamentals of computer science. The idea was inspired by the postsecret website and Japanese religion Shinto and how they would hang anonymous prayers/wishes in the shrines to be read by the Gods.</p>

            <h4>Objects for Grandpeople (Microsoft brief)</h4>
            <p>Working in a team of four, we worked together to create the networked bowl. Andrew's grandparent Frances had an avid interest in baking, the problem however was that Andrew and Frances did not see each other often as they lived far apart and if Andrew wanted a recipe, Frances would offer a vague description of the recipe e.g. she might have said "a pinch of...". </p>
            <p>The networked bowl enabled Frances to pass Andrew baking recipes; the network oject displayed an indicator to Andrew so that he knew the of the ingredients and a recording of Frances' spoken instruction.</p>
