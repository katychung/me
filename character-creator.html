      <h1>Character Creator</h1>
      <p>In December 2017, GoAnimate launched an alpha of their long awaited apps, the Video Maker and Character Creator.
        It marked a significant milestone for the business &mdash; rebuilding the platforms from the ground up and transitioning from an outdated Flash app to HTML5.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>The Character Creator lets users create customized characters, similar to those found in the gaming world. Once a character is created, it is taken into the Video Maker app where the user can "magically" animate the character for their video.</p>
        <p>During the alpha phase, we received substantial customer feedback on the app &mdash; enough to make it a priority for the beta launch that was set for May 2018. It was January so time was running out.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Problems</h2>
        <p>The key problems identified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"I don't want all my characters to be the same height -- it's unrealistic."</li>
          <li>"Where can I find the character I want to edit / copy?"</li>
          <li>"Why is the Fireman's outfit purple?"</li>
          <li>"I changed the hair color to match my own but it keeps resetting every time I select a differents hair style!"</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="section-title">Role</h2>
        <p>Collaborating in a small team &mdash; we enhanced the Character Creator over a span of 4-5 months.
           I led the initiative to improve the user experience of the Character Creator and the integration with the Video Maker.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enable character diversity</li>
          <li>Streamline core interactions</li>
          <li>Ensure design consistency</li>
          <li>Ensure scalability and reduce internal dependencies</li>
          <li>Smooth content delivery process</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Height Change</h2>
        <p>From empirical observation and user feedback, we could see that users create custom characters of people they know including: themselves, friends, family, colleagues.</p>
        <p>In the past, characters in the app where always of a fixed height. We knew this was limiting because we would see users create a character line-up consisting of their colleagues but the height of each person would be the same. We knew this was a let down for users and we knew we had to fix it going forward.</p>
        <p>Today we are able to support characters with different heights. It is a small step to providing more diversity.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Color</h2>
        <p>The user can change color of the character's clothes, shoes, hair, skin etc. For skin and hair color, we would remember the user's color choice so that they can try different hair styles more efficiently. For clothes however, we would revert back to the default color of the outfit.</p>

        <p>Why have two different behaviours? We had many industry outfits where color was critical -- e.g. a firemans outfit is typically yellow.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Impact</h2>
          <p>The beta launch was successful and early feedback from existing customers suggests that they welcome the new features and changes that will enhance their work and workflow!</p>
          <h2 class="section-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p>I am proud of the team I worked with -- their knowledge, commitment and enthusiam. I learnt a lot from this project including:</p>
          <ul>
		      <li>having the right mix of team members and skillsets is really really important</li>
		      <li>the importance of setting expectations across the company about the time required to deliver excellence; normally it takes longer than the time given but this is OK if we are all on the same page about what is being delivered</li>
	      </ul>
